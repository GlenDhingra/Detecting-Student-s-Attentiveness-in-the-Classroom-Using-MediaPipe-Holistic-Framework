# Improving-Learning-efficiency-of-students-in-classroom-by-computing-attentiveness

Project Overview:

This project, conducted from April 2022 to November 2022, is dedicated to enhancing the learning efficiency of students in the classroom. We aim to achieve this by measuring and improving students' attentiveness using machine learning techniques. Specifically, we have developed an ML model that assesses the student's level of attentiveness by analyzing their body stance and facial expressions. This model is implemented in Python using OpenCV for image processing.

The outcome of this project has resulted in the submission of a technical paper that elaborates on the utilization of the Mediapipe Holistic framework to track facial, hand, and body landmarks from video frames in real time. This paper has been submitted to the International Journal of Computational Intelligence.

Key Objectives:

ML Model for Attentiveness: The primary goal is to develop an ML model capable of measuring and analyzing students' attentiveness during classroom sessions.

Body Stance and Facial Expressions: We focus on identifying the students' attentiveness level by examining their body stance and facial expressions in real-time.

Academic Recognition: Our research work is recognized and submitted to the International Journal of Computational Intelligence, which underlines the significance of our approach.

Technical Paper:

We are delighted to announce the submission of a technical paper that elucidates the methodology and findings of this project. The paper covers the following aspects:

Introduction: An introduction to the project's context, goals, and the problem it addresses.

Mediapipe Holistic Framework: A detailed explanation of how the Mediapipe Holistic framework is employed to track facial, hand, and body landmarks from video frames in real-time.

ML Model Development: Insights into the development of the ML model for measuring attentiveness.

Results and Implications: An analysis of the results and the potential implications for enhancing learning efficiency in the classroom.
